    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <ul>
            <strong>Burger patties: </strong> 
                <li>First thing first, miced the 
                    the meat using a ground machine or ask you butcher to miced for 
                    you.</li>
                    <li>
                        After you get all your meat miced, it's time to blend very 
                        well all together.
                    </li>
                    <li>Prepare the patties ball (better use a scale), I like to 
                        prepare patties with 150 - 170 g each, with this weight
                        it's possible to adjust to point of the meat, middle well,
                        well done, etc, according to your guesses tasty.
                     </li>
                     <li>Now with all the patties balls ready, it's time to modeling 
                        the patties, if you have a 11cm form will be esiers, other wise,
                        you can just modeling with your hands till get a thump finger 
                        thickness.
                     </li>
            </ul>   
        </li>
        <li>Cut the buns in half and reserve</li>
        <li>Cut the tomatoes in slices, not to thin and not to thicker</li>
        <li>If you prefer cut the onios in slices as well</li>
        <li>Arrange the pickles, in case it's not cuted, slices 
            them thiner.</li>    
        <li>
            <ol>
                <strong>The Mayonese directions</strong>
                <li>On the blender cup, add 250 ml of milk.</li>
                <li>a pinch of salt</li>
                <li>The fresh garlic</li>
                <li>1 tsp of mustard</li>
                <li>A pinch of black pepper</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>
                     Blend all those ingredients for at least 30sec, if is longer 
                    it's better. Here we're preparing the milk's protein to 
                    emulsify with the Oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Passing the 30sec, try it, to check if it's according 
                    to your flavor. At this time you can adjust the salt,
                    black pepper, garlic and the mustard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All good with your mayo base, it's time to incorporate
                    the oil into the milk. Turn-on the blender and slowly 
                    add the oil. For this amount of milk, will need around 
                    300 - 500ml of oil. That's will depend how thicker you
                    like your mayonese.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So, at this point all your ingredients and base should be ready to 
        start the BBQ time or just heat the fried pot to smell the burger 
        aroma
    </p>
    <p>All set up for your family or friend meal, it's time for grill the patties
        3-5 min each side will be just good to get the right meat point.
