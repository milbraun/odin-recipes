                <li><strong>750g of knuckle:</strong> I like to use knuckle, as it's low fat meat, than
                    I can add just pure fat or a high fat meat, like 
                    brisket or ribs.            
                </li>
                <li><strong>250g of fat:</strong> Pay attention on the meat
                    fat percentage to not add to much meat and reduce the fat %!

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <ol>
            <strong>Burger patties: </strong> 
                <li>First thing first, miced the 
                    the meat using a ground machine or ask you butcher to miced for 
                    you.</li>
                    <li>
                        After you get all your meat miced, it's time to blend very 
                        well all together.
                    </li>
                    <li>Prepare the patties ball (better use a scale), I like to 
                        prepare patties with 150 - 170 g each, with this weight
                        it's possible to adjust to point of the meat, middle well,
                        well done, etc, according to your guesses tasty.
                     </li>
                     <li>Now with all the patties balls ready, it's time to modeling 
                        the patties, if you have a 11cm form will be esiers, other wise,
                        you can just modeling with your hands till get a thump finger 
                        thickness.
                     </li>
            </ol>   
        </li>
        <li>Cut the buns in half and reserv</li>
        <li>Cut the tomatoes in slices, not to thin and not to thicker</li>
        <li>If you prefer cut the onios in slices as well</li>
        <li>Arrange the pickles, in case it's not cuted, slices them thiner.</li>
